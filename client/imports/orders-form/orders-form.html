<!--Now let's bind the form model to the form and its input elements. Here we use
special form directives: ngFormModel and ngControl, that do all the magic by binding
properties, that we just defined, to the DOM elements.-->

<!-- It's worth mentioning one more great feature that appeared in Angular 2. It's possible
 now to define and use local variables in a template. For example, to add a party we'll need
 to take the current state of the form and pass it to an event handler. -->

<form [ngFormModel]="ordersForm" #f="ngForm" (submit)="addOrder(f.value)">

    <!--In Angular 2, events are indicated by the round bracket () syntax.
     Here we are telling Angular to call a method addParty on submit and pass in the value of the form, f. -->

    <label>Name</label>
    <input type="text" ngControl="name">

    <label>Description</label>
    <input type="text" ngControl="description">

    <label>Source</label>
    <input type="text" ngControl="source">

    <label>Destination</label>
    <input type="text" ngControl="destination">

    <button>Add</button>
</form>
